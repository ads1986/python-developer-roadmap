# Python Developer Roadmap

When starting in a Python Development career, seems to be obvious that we need start from the language basis and fundamentals, but is not simple as that. For this reason, i started to search more for any roadmap or guideline that could be a good starting point, so I found this two excelente articles [Python Developer Roadmap in 2021](https://dev.to/hb/python-developer-roadmap-in-2021-2bmo) and [Python Developer](https://roadmap.sh/python) that I'll use to guide my studies.

Been a experienced Java developer, I decided to share here all my learning journey with Python. I think my learning curve would be a little bit shorter thant someone starting programing now, but a think I could help who is in the same learning path.

## 1. Checklist of Learning

To have the control of what I learned and how many times I visited a specific topic, I include a number inside square brackets before the topic`s name. This number will be increased every time I revisited the topic. If the learning generate any artefact, a link will be included in the topic as in the example below :
